## As you can gues from the name this is a simple Weather App.
#### I have used the Open Weather APi and the fetch method. The icons are from an external source that I have downlaoded and renamed according to the icon names returned to us

###### It is possible to add up to 4 cities if you want to add more you will recieve an alert
###### The names of the cities are pushed into an array in order to preserve duplicate entries. The cities are pushed into array with toLowerCase() built it method so it doesn't matter how the input is entered duplicate cities won't be displayed
###### The app displayes an alert in case of empty or invalid inquerys (example: "dfksahgfk" instead of a real city)
###### I have used the unsplash Api as a background for tablets and pc's however you will see just a blue screen as a background in case you are using a mobile phone.

###### For the sake of simplicity I haven't added any exit buttons.
